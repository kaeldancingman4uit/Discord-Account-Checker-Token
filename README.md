## 🚀 Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/discord-account-checker.git
cd discord-account-checker
```

2. Install dependencies:

3. Add your tokens to `tokens.txt` (one token per line)

---

## ▶️ Usage

```bash
python main.py
```

The program will:

* Load tokens from `tokens.txt`
* Send requests to the Discord API
* Validate each token
* Display results in the console

## 📝 Example Output

```
[VALID] user#1234 | ID: 123456789012345678 | Nitro: Yes | 2FA: Enabled
[INVALID] Token is invalid or expired
```

---

## 🌐 Proxy Support (Optional)

If proxy support is implemented:

Add proxies in the following format:

```
http://username:password@ip:port
```

Store them in `proxies.txt` (if supported by your implementation).

---

## 🔒 How It Works

The script sends a GET request to:

```
https://discord.com/api/v9/users/@me
```

With the header:

```
Authorization: <TOKEN>
```

* `200 OK` → Token is valid
* `401 Unauthorized` → Token is invalid

## 📊 Possible Statuses

| Status       | Description                   |
| ------------ | ----------------------------- |
| VALID        | Token is valid                |
| INVALID      | Token is invalid              |
| LOCKED       | Account requires verification |
| RATE LIMITED | Too many requests             |

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

* Do not abuse the API.
* Use delays between requests to avoid rate limits.
* Do not check accounts you do not own.
* The author is not responsible for misuse.
